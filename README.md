# sticker_pop

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Start, Hono, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Start** - SSR framework with TanStack Router
- **React Native** - Build mobile apps using React
- **Expo** - Tools for React Native development
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **workers** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **Cloudflare D1** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting
- **Husky** - Git hooks for code quality
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) with Drizzle ORM.

Runtime database access uses the Cloudflare `DB` binding from `packages/infra/alchemy.run.ts`. If a local `DATABASE_URL` is present, it is only for database tooling.

Alchemy provisions the D1 database and applies migrations during `deploy`.

1. Generate migration files:

```bash
bun run db:generate
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
Use the Expo Go app to run the mobile application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@sticker_pop/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Deployment

### Alchemy

- Target: web on Cloudflare + server on Cloudflare
- Configure provider login: `cd packages/infra && bunx alchemy login --configure`
- Dev: bun run dev
- Deploy: bun run deploy
- Destroy: bun run destroy

`alchemy login --configure` stores the selected Cloudflare, Neon, PlanetScale, and/or Prisma provider profiles under `~/.alchemy`; no provider-specific setup command is required by this scaffold.

Deploys are staged and default to a personal `dev_<username>` stage. For production, run the deploy with an explicit stage from `packages/infra`:

```bash
cd packages/infra && bunx alchemy deploy --stage production
```

### Production origins

- Required after the first deploy: set `CORS_ORIGIN` in `apps/server/.env` to the exact deployed web origin, such as `https://app.example.com`, then deploy the server again.

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Initialize hooks: `bun run prepare`
- Run checks: `bun run check`
